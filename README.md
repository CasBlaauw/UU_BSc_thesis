# UU BSc thesis
The code for my thesis to cap off my bachelor in Molecular Life Sciences, on dynamic eQTLs in C. elegans during development and heat stress.
The fundamentals of the code, implementing the data preparation and a test bagging run, were written by my Basten Snoek, my supervisor.
I worked on revising the code, writing the analysis, and plotting the results.
